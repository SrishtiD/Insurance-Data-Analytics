# Insurance Data Analytics Project
Comprehensive data engineering and analysis of insurance data, focusing on customer demographics, vehicle information, and claim patterns.

## Project Overview
This project combines data engineering and advanced analytics to derive actionable insights from a comprehensive insurance dataset. We analyze customer demographics, vehicle information, and claim patterns to optimize risk assessment and pricing strategies.

## Key Findings
- The 20-29 age group has the highest total claim payout, crucial for targeted risk assessment.
- Significant state-wise variations in average customer age, impacting regional pricing strategies.
- Newer vehicles (2020-2024) are overrepresented, indicating potential bias in the dataset.

## Data Engineering Process
- Merged and cleaned data from multiple sources (Cars, Customers, Households).
- Handled missing values and duplicates to ensure data integrity.
- Standardized date formats for consistent analysis.

## Analytical Highlights
1. **Vehicle Value Distribution**: Right-skewed, majority under $2,000.
2. **Annual Mileage**: Most customers drive less than 20,000 miles/year.
3. **Premium Distribution**: Concentrated between $0-$500 for 6-month periods.
